ðŸ§ª If it still closes unexpectedly:
Hereâ€™s how you can see the error before it disappears:

Instead of just:

cmd
Copy
Edit
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --dbs
Try:

cmd
Copy
Edit
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --dbs
pause
The pause command forces the terminal to wait for you to press a key â€” so you can see any error messages before the window closes.

ðŸ“¦ Also check:
Do you have Python installed? Run:

cmd
Copy
Edit
python --version
If you get an error, thatâ€™s the root of the problem.

If sqlmap came in a .zip file, make sure it's fully extracted, not running from inside the zip.

Let me know what happens when you run python sqlmap.py -h â€” whether it shows help text or crashes. Thatâ€™ll help pinpoint it fast.
