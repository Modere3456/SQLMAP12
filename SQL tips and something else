tamper scripts like --tamper=charencode, --tamper=space2comment, and --tamper=randomcase are common when hackers want to evade detection by WAFs (Web Application Firewalls). These are essential for stealth operations.

--union-cols and --sql-query are crucial for fine-tuning attacks when the hacker needs specific results from the database, such as usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data.

--proxy, --tor, and --user-agent are used frequently by hackers trying to hide their identity or avoid IP blacklisting.

--current-user, --current-db, and --is-dba are often used in combination to escalate privileges once an attacker gains initial access. A real attacker will try to get as much info as possible without dumping everything.

Real-world attacks often combine sqlmap with other tools (like Burp Suite, nmap, or custom scripts) to maximize efficiency and avoid detection. For example:

Use nmap for service enumeration.

Then use sqlmap to exploit known vulnerabilities.

Finally, combine with Burp Suite for deeper analysis and data exfiltration.

Common Tools in Real Attacks:
Real attackers, whether ethical or malicious, don’t just rely on sqlmap. Here’s a toolkit they might use:

nmap (for scanning and service enumeration)

Burp Suite (for intercepting requests, manual testing)

Metasploit (for further exploits once a vulnerability is found)

Hydra or Medusa (for brute-force)

Nikto or OWASP ZAP (for vulnerability scanning)

Custom scripts (tailored to specific targets)

Important Reminder:
Using sqlmap illegally (without permission) is against the law. Ethical hackers only use sqlmap in authorized environments like bug bounty programs or penetration tests.
